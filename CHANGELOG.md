# Changelog

All notable changes to NOOP. NOOP is an independent, experimental project — not the WHOOP app, and
not affiliated with WHOOP. It reads a strap you own, on your own device, fully offline. Dates are
approximate; downloads are on the [Releases](https://github.com/NoopApp/noop/releases) page.

## What to expect

- **Independent, and experimental.** Treat NOOP as a capable work-in-progress rather than a finished
  product.
- **WHOOP 4.0 is the supported path.** It is tested and works end to end. WHOOP 5.0/MG is newer: live
  heart rate works today, but deeper metrics (recovery, strain, sleep) for 5/MG are still being
  figured out. NOOP always tells you what's live versus still building.
- **Your scores build over a few nights.** Live heart rate is instant; recovery, strain and sleep
  sharpen as NOOP learns your baseline. Import your WHOOP export to backfill your history instantly.
- **Everything stays on your device.** No account, no cloud, no sync.

## 1.5 — WHOOP 5/MG: secure-pairing fix

- **Fixed (experimental): WHOOP 5.0/MG stuck at "Finishing the secure pairing handshake."** The 5/MG
  strap requires an encrypted (bonded) Bluetooth link before it will let the app subscribe to its
  characteristics — it was rejecting them with "Authentication is insufficient," so the handshake
  waited forever and live heart rate never arrived. NOOP now writes the `CLIENT_HELLO` with-response
  to trigger just-works bonding, then subscribes once the link is authenticated. Diagnosed from a
  shared strap log by a contributor on issue #17. **Still experimental on 5/MG** — if you have one,
  please try it and share your strap log so we can keep improving it. WHOOP 4.0 is unaffected.

## 1.4 — Live heart rate that doesn't freeze

- **Fixed: live heart rate freezing mid-session.** The WHOOP firmware lets its realtime stream lapse
  if it isn't periodically re-armed, which left heart rate stuck on a stale number while the strap was
  still "connected" — the only fix was a manual disconnect/reconnect. NOOP now runs a 30-second
  keep-alive that re-arms the realtime stream, re-subscribes a dropped notification, and — if nothing
  has arrived for two minutes — reconnects on its own. This ports the macOS app's existing keep-alive
  to Android, so the two platforms behave the same.
- **Fixed: a corrupt Bluetooth packet could wedge the live stream.** The frame reader now rejects an
  impossible frame length and resyncs to the next packet, and starts each connection from a clean
  buffer, so a single bad packet can't freeze the stream until you reconnect.

## 1.3 — Stays connected in the background

- **New: keeps your strap connected when the app is closed.** On Android, NOOP runs a quiet ongoing
  foreground-service notification that holds the Bluetooth link open, so your heart rate keeps
  streaming and offloads keep landing even after you swipe the app away. On macOS this already came
  for free — close the window and NOOP keeps running from the menu bar.
- **New: "Keep connected in the background" toggle** in Settings → Strap, on by default. Turn it off
  and NOOP disconnects whenever you close the app (and drops the notification with it).
- **Fixed:** the strap dropping the instant you closed the app (the connection used to be torn down
  with the screen). The BLE client is now owned by the app process, not the UI.
- **Fixed:** the Android notification permission is now actually declared and requested, so the
  background notification can appear on Android 13+.

## 1.2 — Readiness, and the start of WHOOP 5/MG

- **New: Readiness.** A "should you push today?" card on Today that synthesizes established
  sports-science signals from your own history — HRV vs your baseline (Plews/Buchheit), resting-heart-
  rate drift (Lamberts), sleeping respiratory rate, training-load balance (the acute:chronic workload
  ratio, Gabbett) and training variety (monotony, Foster) — into one headline (Primed / Balanced /
  Strained / Run down) with the drivers beneath it. Pure on-device math; not medical advice.
- **WHOOP 5/MG: live heart rate now works.** Deeper 5/MG metrics (recovery, strain, sleep) are still
  experimental and being worked on.
- **Opt-in WHOOP 5/MG protocol probes** under Settings → Experimental, for 5/MG owners who want to
  help map the protocol. Off by default; never affects WHOOP 4.0.
- **Localized exports import fully.** German (and other localized) WHOOP exports now import with real
  values, not blanks — the column headers are mapped, not just the filenames.
- **Fixes.** The WHOOP 5/MG "stuck connecting" state, and the macOS "Choose export" button.

## 1.1 — Scores live from the strap

- **On-device scoring.** Recovery, strain and sleep now compute live from the strap, not only from an
  import. They calibrate over your first few nights, like any recovery wearable.
- **Pick your strap** (WHOOP 4.0 or 5.0/MG) before connecting, so it looks for the right one.
- **Universal macOS build** that runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon.

## 1.0 — First release

- Pair directly with a WHOOP strap over Bluetooth — no WHOOP account, no cloud.
- Compute recovery, strain, HRV and sleep locally on your own device.
- Bring your history: import a WHOOP export, an Apple Health export, or Android Health Connect.
